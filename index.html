            <p class=CrawlText>2021 was so full of hardships and setbacks my joining BeCode felt like bliss. I had been looking forward to this for months.</p>
            <p class=CrawlText>Now it's game on and there's no time to falter nor fail. If anything, I find it reassuring to be surrounded with like-minded people. We strive and grind together, bound by the most solid thread of fate.</p>
            <p class=CrawlText>Though the first two days proved challenging, I ended up prevailing and intend to keep on doing so until I can look back and thank everyone for this joyful ride. No more regrets. Time to weather the storm.</p>
